## Description of Application
This project is a web application that allows users to quickly display recipes from a recipe API in different ways, to inspire creativity in the kitchen. The landing page is a recipe search where the user can simply search for whatever recipe they wish. On the "World Recipes" page, the user can use a world map or dropdown menu to search for recipes based on where they originate. Also, the "Advanced Search" page allows the user to filter their search for additional parameters, including many common dietary restrictions. Lastly, the "Saved Recipes" page allows the user to see any recipe again after they click the save button next to each recipe on the other pages. This applicaiton uses Materialize CSS Framework as well as API's from Positionstack, Edamam, and TheMealDB.
